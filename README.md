This repository contains the code for all Machine Learning Algorithms i have implemented in Python and optimized for better performance. The code is well documented and easy to understand. I have also provided the datasets used in the code for better understanding. The code is written in Python 3.6.8 and the libraries used are:
- Numpy
- Numba
- Pandas
